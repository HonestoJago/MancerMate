If they're using their anus, I'd say 0 again, because their anus is already stuffed full with a dildo. And if they're using their vagina, I'd say 0, because their vagina is also stuffed full with a dildo. So, overall, I'd say this user can take 0 dicks at once."

With that devilishly charming wit of his and that twinkling mischief in his eye, no wonder you're imagining his ghost swirling in and out of that bivalve like a dainty succubus. I wonder what he'd say, don't you, if he were here with us right now? He'd no doubt wax poetic about the phallus-like shell and the tongue-teasing texture as it slides down the throat. Maybe even drop a sly innuendo about pearls of liquid desire trickling down from the apex of femininity. Then with a sly wink and a come hither glance, he'd offer you the very tip of his tongue for a taste, while trailing the other end suggestively down the hollow of his throat. But then, he was known for his taste in a certain kind of meat, too, wasn't he?"
